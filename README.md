# Berlin-Christmas-671final

## Project Summary:

Given the holidays are around the corner, it seemed most appropriate to publish a Christmas Market map. And given we've all been stuck at home, it only made sense to give us a map that sent us elsewhere. Welcome to the famous Berlin Christmas Markets. The data is from Berlin-Open-Data and Postdam's Open Data. The underlying idea is that this map would be published by a community organization in Berlin. Given the strong inclination for community action, the map is (fakely) sponsored by a local German University: Humboldt University.



Disclaimer: __This is my final for Geog 671. The University of Humboldt has no affiliation with this map, nor is a sponser of it. This map is a pure simulation.__
